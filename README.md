- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaouSama2802 aka Luis Sanchez.
- 👀 I’m interested in web developing and still learning about fields that I might like.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any starter projects that include java or javascript.
- 📫 How to reach me; e-mail me at luis.sanchez080@mymdc.net, my non-school e-mail is plagued with spam :(
